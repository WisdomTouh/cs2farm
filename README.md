Counter-Strike 2 -- AutoFarm

I created an autofarm on cs2!
What is this one doing?! It automatically enters your farm dust2 servers and moves so as not to be excluded from the game for afk

- This is just an Auto Farm, it doesn't change/add anything to your game!
You have no reason to fear that you will be banned :)
- Some commands were just changed in the game file, which gives you an extra auto connect, press the W A S D buttons automatically
